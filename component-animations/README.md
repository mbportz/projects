# Component Animation Collection

This folder contains reusable UI components with pure CSS animations. Each component demonstrates modern CSS animation techniques that can be easily reused or modified for various UI designs.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Centralized collection of small, isolated animated components for reference, reuse, or integration into any web project.

## üì¶ Contents

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Animated Card Border**
- File: `animated-card-border.md`
- Description: A card component with a rotating glowing border using `conic-gradient`, CSS custom properties, and the experimental `@property` rule.
- Technologies:
  - Pure CSS (no JavaScript)
  - Flexbox layout
  - Modern CSS animation

### (Future Components)
- You can add new animation components here as your collection grows:
  - Button hover effects
  - Scroll-based animations
  - Loading spinners
  - Modal open/close transitions
  - Slide-in sidebars

---

## üîß Best Practices

- Focus on pure CSS whenever possible for smoother, hardware-accelerated animations.
- Use modern properties like `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, and `clip-path` for highly performant animations.
- Avoid animating layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`) unless necessary.
- Use `transition` for state changes and `@keyframes` for continuous looping animations.

---

## üåê Browser Notes

- Experimental features like `@property` require modern browsers.
- Always test components across multiple devices and browser versions.
- Use fallback styles where needed.
